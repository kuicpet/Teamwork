## API Documentation

The documentation for the Postit API can be found [here.] 

## Key Features
##### Users
  - 
##### Authentication
  - Teamwork uses JWT for authentication.
  - On successfull sign up or sign in, the user receives a token in the `OAuth` header which can be used to authenticate requests to protected endpoints.
  For a list of endpoints that are protected and those that are not, see our [documentation]

##### Real time updates
  - The client side implementation uese React, which helps ensure that the app updates in real time. You can interact with the hosted app [here.]

##### Password recovery
  - Forgot your password? No problem. Users can request a password reset, and get a mail with reset instructions.

## Technology Stack

Teamwork uses the PERN (PostgreSql, Express, ReactJs, NodeJs) stack.

#### Client Side: 
  - Front-end implementation in REACT
  - Styling with CSS
  

#### Server Side:
  - Server-side implementation is built on NODE, with an
      EXPRESS server and POSTGRES DB.

#### Authentication and Code Base Organization
  - Written in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015)
  - BABEL transpiler ##### Email Notifications
  - Users get email notifications when an urgent or a critical message is posted by other members in groups to which they belong.
##### Email Notifications
  - Users get email notifications when an urgent or a critical message is posted by other members in groups to which they belong.

  - Json Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication.  
    
#### Code Quality
  - Uses ESLINT which was configured to use Airbnb-base rules for ensuring code quality.


## Dependencies
To use Teamwork, you would need: 
  - [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) - a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
  - [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) - a popular object-relational database management system (ORDBMS).
  - Other dependencies are listed in the package.json and should be installed with `npm install` on the command line.
  - Environment variables defined in a `.env` file. You can find a `.sample.env` file in the repository root to guide you on setting up your `.env` file.

## Installation
To get started, 
- Clone this repository to your local machine using https://github.com/kuicpet/Teamwork.git
- Navigate to the root of the cloned local repository.
- Create a file named `.env` using the `.sample.env` file - located on the repository root folder - as a guide.
- Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
- Run `npm start` to run the application.

## Tests
Three kinds of tests have been included:
- API Server tests
- Client side tests for react implementation


##### Server tests
Server side tests can be run on the command line with `npm test`

##### Client tests
Client side tests can be run on the command line with `npm run client-test`

##### Unit tests
End-to-End tests can be run on the command line with `npm run e2e-test`. For this to work however, you would need to:
- create a `bin` folder in the root of your branch,
- start the api server (on e2e mode) on a separate terminal with `npm run `.
- Run the End-to-End tests can be run on the command line with `npm run `

If you discover a bug while testing or using app, please [create an issue](https://github.com/kuicpet/Teamwork/issues/new) to report it. That is a way to contribute to the development of Postit.
